# **Laboratory 4**

Use this exercise to see how cleaning and engineering features not only “debug” your data, but also reveal deeper trends that might influence future design decisions for your platform.

Create your **OWN DATASET**.

**Your codes must perform the following**:
1. Convert timestamp to datetime and

>a. sort the data

>b. Identify and handle missing values in error_flag

>c. Create these visualizations:
* Boxplot of time_spent
* Count plot of user action
* Line plot showing error_flag trends per day


Bonus Tasks (Optional):
* Highlight the day with the highest average error rate.
* Suggest possible reasons behind spikes in error or unusual time_spent values.
* Group data by user_id and compare behavior patterns.

# Mini Grocery Checkout Simulation

Create a simple program that allows the user to simulate a mini grocery checkout experience. The user will input the names and prices of 3 items, and the system will calculate the total, apply a discount if eligible, and print a receipt.

## âœ… Requirements:
1. Prompt the user to enter:
    * Name and price of 3 items
2. Compute the total price
3. If the total exceeds â‚±500, apply a 10% discount
4. Display a receipt that includes:
    * Item names and prices
    * Total before discount
    * Discount amount (if any)
    * Final amount to pay
5. Use functions for:
    * Calculating total
    * Applying discount
    * Displaying the receipt

## ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge:
* Allow the user to input how many items they want to buy (not just 3)
* Use a for loop to collect inputs dynamically

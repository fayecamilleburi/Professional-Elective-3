# **Laboratory 3**

**Scenario: A retail company has shared three datasets about their customer information, sales, and reviews. However, the data is messy and inconsistent.**

**Task**:
1. Read the data files (CSV, Excel, JSON).
2. Optionally perform a brief web scrape on a provided simple webpage (e.g., a promotional page from the company) to extract additional information.
3. Identify and fix issues such as missing values, extra spaces in string fields, and duplicate records.
4. Transform the data by converting data types, renaming columns, and creating new metrics (for example: calculating yearly sales from monthly data).
5. Merge the datasets into a single DataFrame if relevant.
6. Provide brief analysis via visualization to show that data cleaning and transformation were successful.

>Must submit a  Google Colab notebook that:

* Reads and displays the first few rows of each original file.
* (Optional) Contains the web scraping output.
* Shows before-and-after examples of data cleaning.
* Contains transformations including column renaming, type conversion, and derived metric calculations.
